## My GitHub Pages.

Welcome. This is me. These pages lead to code tests for uploading to github, mostly. No production code yet. The following is the default content made from creating these pages on GH. I'll have links to real projects as they become so. That's it. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/breyendo/breyendo.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/breyendo/breyendo.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
